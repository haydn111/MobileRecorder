    <string name="alert_dialog_content">* When checked, a combined video file will be generated in background after you stop recording. This will take a very long time and consume a significant amount of power to complete.\n\n* Only one combining action can exist in background. If you consecutively record videos with this option checked, only your last recording will be combined.\n\nAre you sure to continue?</string>
